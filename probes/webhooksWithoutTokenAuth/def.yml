id: webhooksWithoutTokenAuth
short: This check determines whether the webhook defined in the repository has a token configured to authenticate the origins of requests.
motivation: >
  Webhooks without token authorization have the potential to make projects accessible to third-parties.
implementation: >
  The probe checks all webhooks of a project and returns if it finds a single webhook without token authentication.
outcome:
  - If the project has a single webhook without token authorization, the probe returns one OutcomeNegative (0).
  - If the project does not have any webhooks without token authorization, the probe returns one OutcomePositive (1).
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Check whether your service supports token authentication.
    - If there is support for token authentication, set the secret in the webhook configuration. 
    - If there is no support for token authentication, request the webhook service implement token authentication functionality.
  markdown:
    - Check whether your service supports token authentication.
    - If there is support for token authentication, set the secret in the webhook configuration. See [Setting up a webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks#setting-up-a-webhook).
    - If there is no support for token authentication, request the webhook service implement token authentication functionality by following [these directions](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/securing-your-webhooks).
