id: hasAnyWorkflows
short: Checks whether a project has any workflows.
motivation: >
  This probe is only used to determine whether Scorecard can make conclusive scoring for Dangerous Workflow-related probes.
implementation: >
  The probe checks whether the project has any workflows and does not consider whether they are dangerous. The probe checks the `NumWorkflows` of the raw results.
outcome:
  - If a project does not have any workflows, one finding with OutcomeNegative (0) is returned.
  - If a project has any workflows, one finding with OutcomeNegative (1) is returned.
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Users can change the outcome of this probe by adding at least one workflow.
