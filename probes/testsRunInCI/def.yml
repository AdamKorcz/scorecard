id: testsRunInCI
short: Checks that the project runs tests in the CI for example with Github Actions or Prow.
motivation: >
  Running tests helps developers catch mistakes early on, which can reduce the number of vulnerabilities that find their way into a project.
implementation: >
 The probe checks for tests in the projects CI jobs in the recent commits (~30).
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomePositive for each successful test or check that ran in the projects CI. All findings include the number of merged pull requests as well as how many of these pull requests were tested by tests in the CI. These fields are called "totalMerged" and "totalTested".
  - The probe returns a single OutcomeNotApplicable if the projects has had no pull requests.
remediation:
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Check-in scripts that run all the tests in your repository.
    - Integrate those scripts with a CI/CD platform that runs it on every pull request (e.g. if hosted on GitHub, [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions), [Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow), etc).
